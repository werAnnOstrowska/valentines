# Valentine's day site - project fo fun 

## A single page application built with Vue and GSAP

> Check out my site in it's full glory: [Valentine](https://bubiwalentynki.netlify.app/)

This is a simple project made for fun. Filled with various animations, this single page application has several js scripts, components and a single view to create this fun-filled experience. It's as interactive as one can get - custom button animations, card shaking, cats to pet and heart confetti at the end to finalize the deal.

This site includes gifs and sound effects that make for a creative, loving mess - in a good way.
